The goal is to calculate the speed of each rider and to see if there is any relation between the riders average speed and the distance that they ride.
The code would calculate the average distance based on coordinates of each station and then having the trip duration we would be able to calculate the average speed. They are 
We also have created the column "CountryCombo" which shows the city in which each station is. We were supposed to compare the average speed in different cities but we have changed our hypothesis so we did not really used this column. 


# I have worked on the hypothesis statement part and the plots we needed to generate
